# Assignment
I Used visual studio for the assignments 
I write the code according to the needs of the assignment that give me to do.just run the code it will give output for the assignment project file.
And for the loginform i write the code to write the name movie and review for the movie .you can insert or delete data as per your wish .
once you run the code it will open a login form with options like Name,Movie,Review,Comment
I used ASP.Net Web application with sql server database for the LoginForm Project 
To create a code for the loginform first we need to create a sql server data base.After openning visual studio create a asp.net web application project after openning a projectfile type ctrl+shift+a it will open a new window ,select sql server data base create a new class with that.after opening a class on the left side server explorer is present in that database file is present dragdown select table option.open a table it will open a code modify a code according to needs .Open a design option on the left side present below the page it will shows a table as per the code. 
There select a option login double click it will opens a code modify it run it if the code is correct it will open a window otherwise modify it again.
